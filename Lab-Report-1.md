- For `cd` command
  
  1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
     
     ![](cd-no-arguments.png)

     I believe the reason I got this output is because the `cd` command is used to switch to the given directory path. In my case, I used this command without specifying a path, which is why it didn't display anything.
     
  2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

     We can observe that after using the command with a specified path, the working directory changes to `/home/lecture1`. Additionally, we can see `/lecture1` displayed after user@ to indicate the current working directory.
     
  3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

     The `cd` command is used to switch directories. I believe it cannot be used with a file because a file is not a directory that we can switch to.

- For `ls` command
