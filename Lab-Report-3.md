# Lab Report 3
---
## PART 1
- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
  ```
  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3, 5, 7 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 7, 5, 3 }, input1);
  }
  ```
- An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
  ```
  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 0, 0, 0 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 0, 0, 0 }, input1);
  }
  ```
- The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
  ![](Screenshot/symptom.png)
- The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

  Before:
  ```
  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
  ```
  After:
  ```
  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
  ```

  > The fix involves swapping the source and destination arrays in the assignment. Now, the `newArray` is correctly populated with the reversed elements of the input array `arr`. This way, the original `arr` remains unchanged, and a new reversed array is created as intended.
  
## PART 2
- Command `find`
  1. Using the -mtime option to search for files by modification time:
     
     Example 1: `find ./technical -type f -mtime -7` Finding files modified within the last 7 days in the current directory.
     
     Example 2: `find ~ -type f -mtime +30` Searching for files modified more than 30 days ago in the user's home directory.
     
  2. Using the -size option to search for files by size:
     
     Example 1: `find ~ -type f -size +1M` Finding files larger than 1MB in the user's home directory.
     
     Example 2: `find /var -type f -size -100k` Searching for files smaller than 100KB in the /var directory.
     
  3. Using the -exec option to perform actions on found files:
     
     Example 1: `find ~ -type f -name "*.txt" -exec wc -l {} \;` Finding all text files within the user's home directory and running a command to count the lines in each of them.
     
     Example 2: `find /var -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;` Searching for all directories in the /var directory and changing their permissions to make them writable.
     
  4. Using the -maxdepth option to limit the search depth:
     
     Example 1: `find ~ -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "*.txt"` Finding all text files within the current directory and its immediate subdirectories (limiting the search to a depth of 1).
     
     Example 2: `find /media -maxdepth 2 -type d -name "images"` Searching for directories containing images within the /media directory, limiting the search to a depth of 2.
